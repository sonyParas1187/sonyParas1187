- ðŸ‘‹ Have you ever wondered how businesses manage and make sense of the overwhelming amount of data they generate every day?

Hi there, I'm Sony Paras, a passionate professional hailing from Brampton, ON, with over 5 years of hands-on experience in the dynamic world of data engineering. 

My journey has taken me from collaborating with industry giants like British Telecommunication and AT&T Vodafone to spearheading innovative projects for smaller ventures such as Do-com and CSV Healthcare in the USA, where I've left my mark by optimizing processes and driving tangible results.

But it's not just about the big names; I've also delved into the fascinating realms of machine learning models in healthcare and automation processes, aiming to revolutionize how we harness data for better decision-making.

And to top it off, I've proudly achieved professional certifications as a Google Professional Data Engineer and Azure AI Engineer, along with becoming an Azure Solution Architect Expert, all while completing my Masters in Computer Application in 2014. So, if you're curious about navigating the data landscape or need a fresh perspective on optimizing your business processes, let's chat!
